## Resources

Before proceeding, I'd like to share five excellent resources that I used and reference throughout this post. The top three are crucial because they cover Hugo and PaperMod. The bottom two describe very specific features that I reference in [My website](#my-website), so don't worry about those yet.

My goal is to make the rest of this post self-contained (and link to brief external resources). If something doesn't make sense, please use the first three resources.

Notice this code goes in the `"main"` block from line 17 of `baseof.html`. You could inspect element this page to confirm. The code is quite intuitive, so you should be able to see how this code (in addition to front matter and site variables) causes certain elements to appear at the top of this page.
